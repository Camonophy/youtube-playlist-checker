# Youtube-Playlist Manager

## Description

If you have a YouTube-Playlist with your favourite songs that you really care about, this tool may come in handy to you. 
After running the program for the first time to generate a __*YoutubePlaylist.txt*__ reference file, you can either check 
whether there are some changes; for instance a video was taken down or removed, or generate a new reference file.

 
 
## Dependencies:
 
 Simply run: 
 
 > pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 
 to gather all packages that the program needs.  
 
 
 
## Commands: 

### Write:
Write a new __*YoutubePlaylist.txt*__ reference file.

### Update:
Update your local reference file. 

### check:
Check your local reference file against your YouTube-Playlist to see any differences their contents.

###### (Note that __write__ and __update__ are doing the same internaly, but have been split into two commands to avoid confusion.)



 ## Run:
 > python3 Manager.py
